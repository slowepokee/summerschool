## Work sharing for vector addition

Implement vector addition, i.e. C = A + B, in parallel using OpenMP work
sharing.

Starting from a skeleton code ([skeleton.cpp](skeleton.cpp) or
[skeleton.F90](skeleton.F90)), add the missing computational loop for the
vector addition, enclose it in a parallel region and use work sharing
directives to execute the loop in parallel.
